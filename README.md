## Summary
Our goal with this term project was to implement three differentt (Sarsa, DQN and DDPG) reinforcment learning models from scratch. The project is done as partt of the course EEE485 - Statistical Learning and Data Analysis, offered in Bilkent University. For more information you can check out the report which explains the steps taken in detail and also a small 5-minute presentation in video format which shows how the agents act in each environment.
