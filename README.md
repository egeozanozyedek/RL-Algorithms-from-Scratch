## Summary
Our goal with this term project was to implement three different (Sarsa, DQN and DDPG) reinforcement learning models from scratch. The project is done as part of the course EEE485 - Statistical Learning and Data Analysis offered at Bilkent University. For more information, you can check out the report which explains the steps taken in detail, and also a small 5-minute presentation in video format which shows how the agents act in each environment.
